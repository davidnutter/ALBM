1) Three tuning parameters: light attenuation scaling factor, wind turbulence efficiency factor, snow density
2) Two bathymetry schemes: cylinder and cone (or truncated cone) https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E5%9C%86%E5%8F%B0
3) it should be noted that radiation transfer scheme has some parameters specific for northern high latitudes
4) With/without considering water-sediment heat fluxes
5) Scientific questions include how should represent lakes in coarse-res climate models
6) Using the calibrated model to study the future changes of lake thermal regimes

7) Change the spatial discretization method to the MUSCL scheme based finite volume method
8) Replace SOC with lake and reservoir sediment OC data
9) Add a lake hydrology module (the bottom layer index and thickness should be updated continuously but the total available layers do not change; it is possible the initialized depth is larger than the real lake depth to study the lake evolution)
