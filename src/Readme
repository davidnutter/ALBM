1) Three tuning parameters: light attenuation scaling factor, wind turbulence efficiency factor, snow density
2) Two bathymetry schemes: cylinder and cone (or truncated cone) https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E5%9C%86%E5%8F%B0
3) it should be noted that radiation transfer scheme has some parameters specific for northern high latitudes
4) With/without considering water-sediment heat fluxes
5) Scientific questions include how should represent lakes in coarse-res climate models
6) Using the calibrated model to study the future changes of lake thermal regimes


To-do list
1) Read lake file; 2) lake bathymetry; 3) Initialize lake state variables; 4) read input forcings (spinup 1.5 years)
5) write outputs (lake dimension is record dimension); 6) make sure thermal-related tuning parameters are default values; 
7) check season flags; 8) check season or latitude related parameters in radiation model
9) input is 10-m wind but before input is 2-m wind; 10) consistent light attenuation and bathymetry
11) pr includes prsn?; 12) remove those unused outputs
Done list: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12
