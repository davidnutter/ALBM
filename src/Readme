1) Three tuning parameters: light attenuation scaling factor, wind turbulence efficiency factor, snow density
2) Two bathymetry schemes: cylinder and cone (or truncated cone) https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E5%9C%86%E5%8F%B0
3) it should be noted that radiation transfer scheme has some parameters specific for northern high latitudes
4) With/without considering water-sediment heat fluxes
5) Scientific questions include how should represent lakes in coarse-res climate models
6) Using the calibrated model to study the future changes of lake thermal regimes

7) Change the spatial discretization method to the MUSCL scheme based finite volume method
